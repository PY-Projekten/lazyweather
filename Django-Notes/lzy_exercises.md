## Exercise 1

Alright, the 404 error indicates that there isn't a view associated with the root URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`). However, the error page provides some valuable information about the available URL patterns in the project.

Here's what we can infer from the error page:

- **Admin Interface:** `admin/` - This is Django's built-in admin interface. You can access it by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`. (Note: You'll likely need an admin username and password to log in.)

- **Weather API Endpoint:** `api/v1/weather/<str:location>` - This seems like an API endpoint to fetch weather data for a given location. For instance, you might be able to get weather data for Berlin by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/weather/berlin`.

- **Base API Endpoint:** `api/v1/` - This might be a general landing or information page for the API.

- **Debug Tool:** `__debug__/` - This is related to Django's debugging tools and not directly related to the app's functionality.

### Next Steps for the Exercise:

1. **Visit the Admin Interface:** Try accessing `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`. If you have the credentials, you can log in and explore the data models and their entries.

2. **Test the Weather API Endpoint:** Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/weather/berlin` (or replace 'berlin' with another city) to see what kind of data/response you get.

    *I tested it with various German cities*

3. **Check the Base API Endpoint:** Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/` and see what's displayed there.

    *I got a 404 page*

4. **Reflect on MVT:** As you explore each page, think about which view is handling the request, which template is rendering the content (if any), and which model the data might be coming from.

Let's start with these steps. Please share your observations and any outputs you get from visiting the above URLs.

- **Which view is handling the request**
  
- **Which Template is rendering the content**
  
- **Which Model the data might be coming from**

<br/>
<br/>

## Testing a city URL in the browser:

Certainly! Below is a brief explanation of the JSON schema followed by a snippet of the JSON data:

### Explanation of the JSON Schema:

The JSON data represents weather information structured by date. Each date is a key in the JSON object, and it contains another object as its value. This nested object includes various weather attributes such as `temp_max`, `temp_min`, `precipitation_sum`, and so on. 

Additionally, there is a `weather_times` object that contains hourly weather data. Each hour is represented as a key, and its value is another object containing weather attributes for that specific hour, such as temperature, cloud cover, precipitation, and a weather icon with its description.

### JSON Snippet:```json
[
    {
        "2023-10-25": {
            "temp_max": 13.9,
            "temp_min": 9.8,
            "precipitation_sum": 0.1,
            "snowfall_sum": 0.0,
            "temp_current": 11.3,
            "weather_times": {
                "00": {
                    "temp": 11.5,
                    "cloudcover": 100,
                    "precipitation": 0.1,
                    "snowfall": 0.0,
                    "weathercode": 61,
                    "weather_icon": {
                        "icon": "mdi-weather-partly-rainy",
                        "color": "lightgrey",
                        "description": "Leichter Regen"
                    }
                },
                "01": {
                    "temp": 11.3,
                    "cloudcover": 97,
                    "precipitation": 0.0,
                    "snowfall": 0.0,
                    "weathercode": 3,
                    "weather_icon": {
                        "icon": "mdi-weather-cloudy",
                        "color": "grey",
                        "description": "Bew√∂lkt"
                    }
                }
                // ... (more hourly data)
            }
        }
    }
    // ... (more daily data)
]


```

This snippet illustrates the hierarchical structure of the data, showing how weather information is organized by date and hour, with detailed attributes for each time period.

### Understanding the Response:

- **Title:** "Get Weather" - This indicates the purpose of the page or endpoint.
  
- **Description:** "API view to retrieve the weather data." - A brief explanation of the endpoint's purpose.
  
- **Endpoint Details:**
  
  - GET `/api/v1/weather/berlin` - The HTTP method (GET) and the path indicate how you accessed this data.
  
  - HTTP 200 OK - A standard HTTP response indicating a successful request.
  
  - Allow: OPTIONS, GET - The allowed HTTP methods for this endpoint.
  
  - Content-Type: application/json - The format of the data (JSON in this case).
  
- **Data:** This is the main content, presented in JSON format. It provides detailed weather data for Berlin. At a glance:
  
  - Date-based data (e.g., "2023-10-05") indicating weather details for specific dates.
  
  - Within each date, details like maximum temperature, minimum temperature, current temperature, precipitation, etc.
  
  - Hourly data (e.g., "00", "01", "02") providing weather conditions for each hour, including temperature, cloud cover, precipitation, and a weather icon with its description.

### Connecting to Django MVT:

- **Model:** The data you see likely comes from a model in `models.py` that defines the structure of weather data. Each field in the JSON (like "temp_max", "temp_current", etc.) would correspond to a field in the model.

    *I can't find the attributes "temp_max" and "temp_current" in `models.py`*

- **View:** The logic to fetch this data and present it as a JSON response is handled in a view, specifically an API view. The view would:

  - Extract the location (in this case, "berlin") from the URL.
  
  - Fetch the relevant weather data for Berlin from the model.
  
  - Serialize this data into JSON format.
  
  - Return the serialized data as a response.

- **Template:** In this case, the template isn't a traditional HTML page. Instead, the data is presented in JSON format. However, there's still some structure to how the data is presented, and this structure is determined by how the data is serialized and how the API view is set up.

### Next Steps:

- **Explore More Endpoints:** You can try replacing "berlin" with other city names to see weather data for different locations.
  
- **Understand the Data:** Reflect on the data structure. How might this data be stored in the database? What models might support this structure?

- **Connect with Code:** Open views.py and try to identify the view that handles this endpoint. Look at how it fetches and returns the data. Similarly, in models.py, identify the model that defines this weather data.

<br/>
<br/>

## api/views.py: get_weather

This is the API view that retrieves weather data.

- **Decorator `@api_view(['GET'])`:** This indicates that the view only handles HTTP GET requests.

- **Function Signature `def get_weather(request, location)`:** This function takes two parameters:
  - `request`: The standard Django request object.
  - `location`: This captures the location from the URL (like "berlin").

Inside the function:
- It checks if the request method is GET.
- It calls the `get_weather_data(location)` function from `api.apps.weather.utils` to retrieve weather data for the provided location.
- If data is retrieved successfully, it returns the data with an HTTP status code of 200.
- If no data is found, it returns a 404 Not Found status.
- Any other request methods will result in a 400 Bad Request status.

### Connecting to Django MVT

- **Model:** The `get_weather_data` utility function likely interacts with the WeatherData and Location models to fetch the required data.

- **View:** The `get_weather` function is the view that processes the incoming request, interacts with the model to get data, and decides how to respond.

- **Template:** As this is an API endpoint, there's no traditional HTML template. The data is returned in JSON format directly.

### Key Takeaways & Next Steps

- The view is relatively straightforward. It fetches weather data for a given location and returns it.

- To fully understand the data retrieval process, we'd need to delve into the `get_weather_data(location)` utility function, which is probably where the interaction with the models happens.

<br/>
<br/>

## models.py

### 1. Location Model

The Location model seems to represent geographical locations:
- **latitude and longitude:** Geographical coordinates of the location.
- **name:** A human-friendly name for the location (like "Berlin").

### 2. WeatherData Model

The WeatherData model seems to store weather-related data for specific locations:
- **location:** A foreign key to the Location model, indicating which location this weather data belongs to.
- **data:** A JSONField, which means it can store structured JSON data.
- **date:** The date for which this weather data is applicable.

Now, coming to the attributes "temp_max" and "temp_current" that you observed in the browser: These are likely stored within the data JSONField of the WeatherData model. The JSONField allows for storing structured data in JSON format, so it can contain a variety of nested fields and values. This is quite flexible and allows for dynamic data structures.

For instance, a possible structure for the data field might be:

```json
{
  "temp_max": 15.3,
  "temp_min": 11.7,
  "temp_current": 15.2,
  "weather_times": {
    "00": {"temp": 13.2, ...},
    "01": {...}
  }
}
```

### Tracing the Flow in the Django MVT Context:

- **Model:** The WeatherData model is where the weather data is stored. Specifically, detailed weather data like "temp_max" and "temp_current" are stored within the data JSONField.

- **View:** When you access the endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/weather/berlin`, a view function or class in `views.py` is responsible for fetching the weather data for Berlin from the WeatherData model. It then prepares this data to be shown in the browser.

- **Template:** While traditional web applications might use an HTML template to render the data, in this case, the data is directly serialized to JSON format and sent to the browser, given that it's an API endpoint.

To understand this flow better, you might want to look at the specific view in `views.py` that handles the `/api/v1/weather/<str:location>` endpoint. This will give insights into how the data is fetched from the model and how it's prepared for display in the browser.

<br/>
<br/>

## weather/views.py

### 1. View: location_list

Handles operations related to the list of locations.

- **GET Request:** Retrieves all the locations from the Location model and serializes them using the LocationSerializer. Returns the serialized data.
- **POST Request:** Allows the creation of a new location. It uses the LocationSerializer to validate the data and then saves it.

### 2. View: location_detail

Handles operations related to a specific location, identified by its primary key (pk).

- **GET Request:** Retrieves the location details for the given pk.
- **PUT Request:** Updates the entire location record for the given pk.
- **PATCH Request:** Partially updates the location record for the given pk.
- **DELETE Request:** Deletes the location record for the given pk.

### 3. View: weather_list

Handles operations related to the list of weather data.

- **GET Request:** As per the provided content, this view specifically retrieves weather data for the location named 'hamburg' from the WeatherData model and serializes them using the WeatherDataSerializer.
- **POST Request:** Allows the creation of new weather data. It uses the WeatherDataSerializer to validate the data and then saves it.

### 4. View: weather_detail

Handles operations related to specific weather data, identified by its primary key (pk).

- **GET Request:** Retrieves the weather data details for the given pk.
- **PUT Request:** Updates the entire weather data record for the given pk.
- **PATCH Request:** Partially updates the weather data record for the given pk.
- **DELETE Request:** Deletes the weather data record for the given pk.

### Takeaways

- The views in this file are focused on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Location and WeatherData models.
- They are designed as API views, meaning they return data in a format suitable for machine processing (like JSON) rather than human-readable HTML pages.
- These views interact with the models to fetch or modify data in the database and use serializers (LocationSerializer and WeatherDataSerializer) to convert between Python objects and easily renderable formats like JSON.

<br/>
<br/>

## weather/utils.py

### 1. Utility: get_icon_by_weathercode

- This function takes a weathercode as an argument and returns a weather icon based on this code.
- It first gets the weather_description for the given code using the `WEATHER_DESCRIPTION` dictionary (defined in config.py).
- Then, it returns the corresponding icon from the `WEATHER_ICONS` dictionary (also from config.py).

### 2. Main Function: get_weather_data

- This function retrieves weather data for a given location for a specified number of days (default is 7 days).

**Steps in the function:**

   - **Geolocation:** It uses the `geolocator.geocode` method to convert the provided location (e.g., "berlin") into latitude and longitude coordinates. If successful, it also retrieves a more detailed address.
   - **Database Lookup:** It then checks if this location (based on latitude and longitude) already exists in the Location model in the database.
   - **Location Creation:** If the location does not exist in the database, it creates a new Location object with the retrieved longitude, latitude, and address.
   - **API Request:** The function then makes an HTTP request to open-meteo.com to fetch weather data for the given location and days. It retrieves current weather, hourly, and daily data.
   - **Data Processing:**
     - It processes the received data, extracting relevant details.
     - It constructs a list, `daily_weather_data_list`, containing daily weather data.
     - For each day, it constructs a dictionary containing max temperature, min temperature, precipitation sum, snowfall sum, current temperature, and hourly weather data.
     - For hourly data, it uses the `get_icon_by_weathercode` utility function to get the appropriate weather icon.
   - **Database Storage:** The processed data is then stored in the WeatherData model in the database, associated with the given location.
   - **Return:** Finally, the function returns the constructed `daily_weather_data_list`.

### Takeaways

- The function combines several functionalities: geolocation, database interactions, external API requests, and data processing.
- The detailed attributes like "temp_max" and "temp_current" that you observed in the browser come from the external API request to open-meteo.com. They are processed and stored in the WeatherData model's data JSONField.
